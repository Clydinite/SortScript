# Agent Instruction

this is the repo for the development of the custom sorting DSL, `.order`. this would address issues about not being able to sort files in a way that respect the user's needs. the goal is to be able to sort files in a way that is consistent with the user's preferences and can be used as across teams.

you should explain every step before changing the code.
